      description: "Next under each application you can define one or more constraints in the constraints array attribute. A constraint defines a URL pattern relative to the base-path. You can deny, permit, or require authentication for a specific URL pattern. You can specify roles allowed for that path as well. More specific constraints will take precedence over more general ones."
